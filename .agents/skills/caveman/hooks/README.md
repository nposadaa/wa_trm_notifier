# Caveman Hooks

These hooks are **bundled with the caveman plugin** and activate automatically when the plugin is installed. No manual setup required.

If you installed caveman standalone (without the plugin), you can use `bash hooks/install.sh` to wire them into your settings.json manually.

## What's Included

### `caveman-activate.js` — SessionStart hook

- Runs once when Claude Code starts
- Writes `full` to `~/.claude/.caveman-active` (flag file)
- Emits caveman rules as hidden SessionStart context

### `caveman-mode-tracker.js` — UserPromptSubmit hook

- Fires on every user prompt, checks for `/caveman` commands
- Writes the active mode to the flag file when a caveman command is detected
- Supports: `full`, `lite`, `ultra`, `wenyan`, `wenyan-lite`, `wenyan-ultra`, `commit`, `review`, `compress`

## Optional: Statusline Badge

The flag file bridges the gap between hooks (which Claude sees) and your statusline (which you see). Add this to your statusline script to show which mode is active:

```bash
caveman_text=""
caveman_flag="$HOME/.claude/.caveman-active"
if [ -f "$caveman_flag" ]; then
  caveman_mode=$(cat "$caveman_flag" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ "$caveman_mode" = "full" ] || [ -z "$caveman_mode" ]; then
    caveman_text="\033[38;5;172m[CAVEMAN]\033[0m"
  else
    caveman_suffix=$(echo "$caveman_mode" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')
    caveman_text="\033[38;5;172m[CAVEMAN:${caveman_suffix}]\033[0m"
  fi
fi
```

Badge examples:
- `/caveman` → `[CAVEMAN]`
- `/caveman ultra` → `[CAVEMAN:ULTRA]`
- `/caveman wenyan` → `[CAVEMAN:WENYAN]`
- `/caveman-commit` → `[CAVEMAN:COMMIT]`
- `/caveman-review` → `[CAVEMAN:REVIEW]`

## How It Works

```
SessionStart hook ──writes "full"──▶ ~/.claude/.caveman-active ◀──writes mode── UserPromptSubmit hook
                                              │
                                           reads
                                              ▼
                                     Statusline script
                                    [CAVEMAN:ULTRA] │ ...
```

SessionStart stdout is injected as hidden system context — Claude sees it, users don't. The statusline runs as a separate process. The flag file is the bridge.

## Uninstall

If installed via plugin: disable the plugin — hooks deactivate automatically.

If installed via `install.sh`:
1. Remove `~/.claude/hooks/caveman-activate.js` and `~/.claude/hooks/caveman-mode-tracker.js`
2. Remove the SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit entries from `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. Delete `~/.claude/.caveman-active`
